                    And it came to pass that they would that I should be their aking. 
                    But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, 
                    I did for them according to that which was in my power.

                    Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest he shall come out 
                    in justice against youâ€”lest a aremnant of the seed of Jacob shall go forth among 
                    you as a blion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
